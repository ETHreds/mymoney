## PWA Finance Tracker App (Backend Focus)

This project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) finance tracker application with a focus on showcasing backend development skills using Express.js and PostgreSQL. The core functionalities allow users to manage their finances through a user-friendly interface (optional frontend) and interact with the data through a robust backend API.

**Features:**

- **Backend API:**
  - User Authentication (Optional): Secure user registration, login, and authorization with JWT (JSON Web Token) based access control (optional).
  - CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete transactions and potentially manage accounts/budgets (optional).
  - Data Validation: Robust input validation protects against SQL injection attacks and ensures data integrity.
  - Password Hashing: Secure storage of user passwords using hashing algorithms (if implementing user authentication).
- **Offline Functionality (Optional):**
  - Service Worker Integration (Optional): Caching essential resources for offline access.
  - Local Storage Integration (Optional): Allows adding transactions offline with synchronization upon regaining internet connection.

**Project Setup:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. Configure database connection details in `config.js`.
4. (Optional) Set up a minimal frontend project (Vue.js) for basic UI and interaction testing.

**Running the Application:**

1. Start the backend server: `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
2. The backend API runs on port `3000` by default (you can modify this in `server.js`).
3. Use tools like Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

**Deployment (Optional):**

- Instructions for deploying the backend application to a platform like Heroku are not included but can be found in their documentation.

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for the backend API are located in the `tests` directory.
- Run tests: `npm test` (or `yarn test`)

**Documentation:**

- Code comments and explanations are provided throughout the backend codebase.
- This README file outlines the project functionalities, setup instructions, and deployment considerations.

**Technologies:**

- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - PostgreSQL (database)
  - Sequelize (optional ORM)
- Frontend (Optional):
  - Vue.js (minimal implementation)
- Testing:
  - Jest or Mocha (unit testing frameworks)

**Note:**

- The optional frontend component is intended for basic demonstration purposes. A complete frontend application can be built upon this foundation using Vue.js or other frontend frameworks.
